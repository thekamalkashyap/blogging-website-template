text1: The name is kamal (which is short for kamal kumar or kamal kashyap, depending on where you know me from). I am a 17-year-old North Indian with a tech sort of background and a lot to say about the trends and direction of the scientific world.
text2: I'm very dedicated to learn new things and to truly belive that you should never stop learning. I enjoy creating different things, whether that be websites, application or anything in between.
text3: In my first freelancing work as a web developer I feel like I've been very lucky to experience a broad and diverce part of projects and tasks. I get to deal with everything from user feedback, design and to backend tests and improving parts of our daily operations.
